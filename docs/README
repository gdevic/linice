                        Linice Kernel Level Debugger

Quick Start for 2.4 kernel:

You need to have kernel sources installed, or at least compile kernel headers for the kernel version for which you are linking Linice.

Compile all components:
# cd build
# ./make_bin

Compile kernel specific code:
# cd ../bin
# make

Install Linice:
# ./linsym -i

You can break in at any time using a hotkey Ctrl+Q.

Uninstall Linice:
# ./linsym -x

Please read the documentation file Linice.pdf for detailed description of commands and command line options.
