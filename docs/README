                        Linice Kernel Level Debugger

Quick Start:

You need to have kernel sources installed, or at least compile kernel headers for the kernel version for which you are linking Linice.

Compile all components, depending on the kernel version:
# cd build
# ./make_bin-2.4
	or
# ./make_bin-2.6

This command will also create a correct sym link named 'bin'

Compile kernel specific code:
# cd ../bin
# make

Install Linice:
# ./linsym -i

After this command, Linice should pop up on the VGA screen. Press F5 to let it go.
You can break in at any time using a hotkey Ctrl+Q.

Uninstall Linice:
# ./linsym -x

Please read the documentation file Linice.pdf for detailed description of commands and command line options.
Google the web for the information about all the commands that are compatible with SoftIce.
