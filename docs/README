                        Linice Kernel Level Debugger

Quick Start:

You need to have kernel sources installed, or at least compile kernel headers for the kernel version for which you are linking Linice.

Compile all components, depending on the kernel version:
# cd build
# ./make_bin-2.4
	or
# ./make_bin-2.6

This command will also create a correct sym link named 'bin'

Compile kernel specific code:
# cd ../bin
# make

Install Linice:
# ./linsym -i

You can break in at any time using a hotkey Ctrl+Q.

Uninstall Linice:
# ./linsym -x

Please read the documentation file Linice.pdf for detailed description of commands and command line options.
