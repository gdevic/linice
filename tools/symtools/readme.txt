What is this?

This is a MSVC project that compiles Linsym source files into an MS Windows executable. Only the symbol translation functionality is supported in the Windows version. It can be used to debug symbol translator or to verify its correctness by comparing the outputs from two different platforms (Linice symbol files have to be binary identical whether generated from Linux or Windows versions of Linsym programs).
